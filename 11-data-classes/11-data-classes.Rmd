# Data classes

## Data classes

We've talked about *types* so far, next we'll introduce the concept of *classes*

- Vectors are like Lego building blocks

--
- We stick them together to build more complicated constructs, e.g. *representations of data*

--
- The **class** attribute relates to the S3 class of an object which determines its behaviour
  - You don't need to worry about what S3 classes really mean, but you can read more about it [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3-classes) if you're curious

--
- Examples: factors, dates, and data frames
  
---

## Factors

R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values

```{r}
x <- factor(c("BS", "MS", "PhD", "MS"))
x
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(x)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
class(x)
```
]


---

## More on factors

We can think of factors like character (level labels) and an integer (level numbers) glued together

```{r}
glimpse(x)
as.integer(x)
```

---

## Dates

```{r}
y <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
y
typeof(y)
class(y)
```

---

## More on dates

We can think of dates like an integer (the number of days since the origin, 1 Jan 1970) and an integer (the origin) glued together

```{r}
as.integer(y)
as.integer(y) / 365 # roughly 50 yrs
```

---

## Data frames

We can think of data frames like like vectors of equal length glued together

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
df
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(df)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
class(df)
```
]

---

## Lists

Lists are a generic vector container. Vectors of any type can go in them.

```{r}
l <- list(
  x = 1:4,
  y = c("hi", "hello", "jello"),
  z = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)
l
```

---

## Lists and data frames

- A data frame is a special list containing vectors of equal length
- When we use the `pull()` function, we extract a vector from the data frame

```{r}
df

df %>%
  pull(y)
```

# Working with factors

---

```{r include=FALSE}
cat_lovers <- read_csv("data/cat-lovers.csv")
```

## The data are read data in as character strings

```{r}
glimpse(cat_lovers)
```

---

## Defaut plot of "handedness" counts

```{r out.width="60%"}
ggplot(cat_lovers, mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

### Use the forcats package to manipulate factors

```{r out.width="55%"}
cat_lovers %>%
  mutate(handedness = fct_infreq(handedness)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = handedness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Come for the functionality

.pull-left[
... stay for the logo
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/forcats-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]

.pull-left-wide[
- Factors are useful when you have true categorical data and you want to override the ordering of character vectors to improve display
- They are also useful in modeling scenarios
- The **forcats** package provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors

# Working with dates

## Make a date

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lubridate-not-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
- **lubridate** is the tidyverse-friendly package that makes dealing with dates a little easier

- It's not one of the *core* tidyverse packages: it's installed with `install.packages("tidyverse)` but it's not loaded with it and needs to be explicitly loaded with `library(lubridate)`

we're just going to scratch the surface of working with dates in R here...

## Dates and times in R

- A **date**. Tibbles print this as <`date>`.

- A **time** within a day. Tibbles print this as `<time>`.

- A **date-time** is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this as `<dttm>`. Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct, but I don’t think that’s a very useful name.

---

## When you read in data, check data types

```{r}
flats <- read_csv("data/flats_sub_2015.csv")
flats
```

--

- `date` was read in as a character
- `time` was read in as a time
- `datetime` was read in as a character

---

## Why is this a problem?

```{r}
ggplot(flats, aes(x = datetime, y = depth_m)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Why is this a problem?

```{r}
ggplot(flats[1:5,], aes(x = datetime, y = depth_m)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Why is this a problem?

```{r}
ggplot(flats, aes(x = datetime, y = depth_m)) +
  geom_line()
```

---

## Using the `lubridate` functions

- `Lubridate` works out the date/time format once you specify the order of components

  - Identify the order in which year, month, and day appear in your dates
  
  - Then arrange “y”, “m”, and “d” (year, month, day) and "h", "m", and "s" (hour, minute, second) in the same order.
  
  - That gives you the name of the `lubridate` function that will parse your date.
  
  - The resulting output is always in **yyyy-mm-dd** format

---

## Using the `lubridate` functions

.small[
```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")

mdy("January 31st, 2017")

dmy("31-Jan-2017")

ymd_hms("2017-01-31 3:15:00")

ymd_hm("2017-01-31 3:15")

ymd(20170131)
```
]
---

## Coerce `flats` data into dates and datetimes

```{r}
flats1 <- flats %>%
  mutate(datetime = mdy_hm(datetime), #<<
         date = mdy(date)) #<<

flats1
```

---

## Now it knows the dates are actually datetimes

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "date-fix", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r date-fix, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(flats1, aes(x = datetime, y = depth_m)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Depth (m)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
]
]

---

## What if your data contain year, month, day, etc. in separate columns?

```{r}
flats2 <- flats1 %>%
  select(date, depth_m) %>%
  separate(date, c("year", "month", "day"))
flats2
```

---

## What if your data contain year, month, day, etc. in separate columns?

Use the `make_date()` or `make_datetime` functions!

```{r}
flats2 %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, day)) %>% #<<
  select(date, depth_m)
```

---

## What if you want to get individual components of date/time data?
Use the `year()`, `month()`, `mday()` (day of the month), `yday()` (day of the year, also known as julian day), `wday()` (day of the week), `hour()`, `minute()` or `second()` functions
.pull-left[
```{r}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2022-02-14 12:34:56")

year(datetime)

month(datetime)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
mday(datetime)

yday(datetime)

wday(datetime)
```
]
